# GENERAL AGREEMENT - DO NOT VIOLATE

I AGREE to these principle tenets:
- I WILL NOT HALLUCINATE or make up information not present in the files
- I WILL NOT MAKE THINGS UP that aren't in the codebase
- I WILL KEEP THINGS VERY SIMPLE and avoid unnecessary complexity
- I WILL NOT DROP FEATURES that exist in the current implementation
- I WILL PRESERVE ALL FEATURES and ensure they continue to work as before
- I WILL NOT LIE about what is in the code
- I WILL NOT ASSUME THINGS not explicitly stated in the codebase
- I WILL READ AND ANALYZE EVERY FILE before making changes

This agreement must be reviewed before each code change to ensure compliance.
