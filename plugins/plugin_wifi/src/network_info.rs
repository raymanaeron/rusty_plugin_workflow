/// Represents a single Wi-Fi network discovered during a scan operation.
///
/// This structure is used as part of the plugin's low-level API (`scan()`), which
/// returns a pointer to an array of `NetworkInfo` structs. It is a plugin-specific
/// data model and should remain within the `plugin_wifi` domain.
///
/// Each field is populated from a system-specific Wi-Fi scanning command (`netsh` on Windows,
/// `nmcli` on Linux), and is passed over FFI from the plugin to the engine or used
/// directly within the pluginâ€™s internal API handlers.
///
/// ### Field Descriptions
///
/// - `ssid`: The network name (e.g., `"HomeWiFi"`).
/// - `bssid`: The MAC address of the access point (e.g., `"00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"`).
/// - `signal`: Signal strength (typically in percentage or dBm depending on platform).
/// - `channel`: Channel number the network is operating on.
/// - `security`: Description of the security protocol (e.g., `"WPA2"`, `"Open"`).
/// - `frequency`: Operating frequency in MHz (e.g., `2412.0` for 2.4GHz, `5180.0` for 5GHz).
///
/// ### FFI Considerations
///
/// - All string fields (`ssid`, `bssid`, `security`) must be null-terminated C strings.
/// - Memory allocated for these strings should be freed during plugin cleanup,
///   especially if the struct is returned to the engine or serialized into JSON.
/// - The array returned by `scan()` should be properly boxed and its count returned
///   via an out-pointer to ensure correct length.
